# generative-art
This repo is meant to serve a static github page that produces generative art, later screenshotted and uploaded as my Twitter banner hourly via Firebase Functions. The code for this repo is majorly sourced from [this tutorial](https://github.com/sdedovic/noiseorbit-tutorial) and I simply changed the frameCount starting point and the dimensions to fit the 1500 x 500px banner size.
